# Sage Terminal / CLI Contract

This document lists the CLI/runtime interfaces that `sage-terminal` treats as stable integration points.

## Integration Model

`sage-terminal` is a Rust client over the existing local Sage runtime.

There are two integration paths:

- chat / resume streaming through the existing backend event channel
- one-shot CLI commands for inspect/list/init/verify style operations

## Stable One-Shot JSON Commands

The TUI currently expects these commands to support structured JSON output:

- `sage doctor --json`
- `sage config show --json`
- `sage config init --json`
- `sage sessions --json`
- `sage sessions inspect <session_id|latest> --json`
- `sage skills --json`
- `sage provider list --json`
- `sage provider inspect <provider_id> --json`
- `sage provider verify --json`
- `sage provider create --json`
- `sage provider update <provider_id> --json`
- `sage provider delete <provider_id> --json`

## Stable Startup Entry Surface

The TUI startup layer currently aligns to these commands:

- `sage-terminal run <prompt>`
- `sage-terminal chat <prompt>`
- `sage-terminal config init [path] [--force]`
- `sage-terminal doctor [probe-provider]`
- `sage-terminal provider verify [key=value...]`
- `sage-terminal sessions [limit]`
- `sage-terminal sessions inspect <latest|session_id>`
- `sage-terminal resume [latest|session_id]`

## Contract Expectations

For one-shot JSON commands:

- stdout should be valid JSON when `--json` is used
- error reporting should remain machine-readable enough for the TUI to wrap cleanly
- human-readable formatting can change independently of the TUI

For streaming events:

- event type names should remain explicit
- fields such as `type`, `role`, `content`, `tool_calls`, and `metadata.tool_name` should remain stable or be evolved compatibly

## Change Policy

If one of these contracts must change:

1. change the CLI/runtime contract intentionally
2. update `app/terminal/src/backend/contract.rs`
3. update Rust-side tests
4. update Python-side JSON contract tests
5. update this document if the surface area changed

## Experimental: `sage v2 {run,chat,resume,sessions} --json` (SAgents v2 runtime)

`sage v2 run <task> --json` streams the v2 runtime's native `RuntimeEvent`s as NDJSON
(one JSON object per line, `protocol_version: "sage.runtime/v2"`). CLI framing lines are
interleaved and distinguished by a `cli_v2_` prefix on `type`:

- `cli_v2_session` — first line of a run: `session_id`, `run_id`, `agent_id`, `workspace`, `session_root`, `package_id`;
  `resumed: true` when the CLI is taking over a run left suspended by a previous process
- `cli_v2_interaction` — the run is suspended waiting for an answer: `interaction_id`,
  `interaction_type` (`approval` | `user_input` | ...), `allowed_decisions`, `payload`
- `cli_v2_notice` — human-readable notice
- `cli_v2_result` — last line of a run: `state` (`completed` | `failed` | `cancelled` | `suspended`),
  `interrupted` (true when the user cancelled it with Ctrl-C; process exit code 130), `final_text`, `error`

The driver answers a `cli_v2_interaction` by writing one JSON line to the CLI's stdin:

```json
{"type": "v2_interaction_decision", "interaction_id": "...", "decision": "approve_once", "payload": {}}
```

`decision` must be one of `allowed_decisions`; anything else is coerced to `deny`/`cancel`.
`payload` carries `{"text": "..."}` for `submit` / `change_direction` answers.

Approval interactions (`interaction_type: "approval"`) list `approve_once`, `deny`, `cancel` and,
when the call may be remembered, `approve_and_remember`. The `payload` then also carries
`approval_matcher` (`tool_name`, `fingerprint`, `summary` — what exactly would be remembered:
the CLI matcher uses exact arguments for `execute_shell_command` (including unchanged shell
text, `workdir` and `env_vars`), the original `file_path`
for `file_write` / `file_update`, and the full arguments otherwise), `approval_scopes`
(`["session", "workspace"]`) and `persistent_approval_allowed: true`. Answering
`approve_and_remember` makes the runtime skip the approval for later calls that match; the
decision line may carry `"payload": {"scope": "session" | "workspace"}` (default `session`).
`session` lives in the session's derived state; `workspace` is kept by the CLI under
`<session_root>/approvals/` keyed by the workspace path, so every later session in the same
workspace is covered (the file is never written into the workspace itself). A scope the runtime
does not offer is tightened to `session`. Remembered calls surface a `policy.approval.remembered`
event when remembered and a `policy.decision.recorded` event with `remembered_by` /
`remembered_scope` when auto-approved. `sage v2 chat` exposes `/approvals` (list, both scopes)
and `/forget <n>|all` (revoke). `sage v2 approvals [--workspace <path>] [--json]` lists the
workspace-scoped entries without opening the session store (one JSON object with `workspace`,
`store`, `total`, `list`), and `sage v2 approvals forget <n>|all` revokes them.
Legacy shell/path fingerprints are not reused after the matcher upgrade; those operations
require approval again. Invalid remembered entries are ignored individually, retaining valid
entries, and `/forget all` also removes corrupt approval documents.

`--approval-mode` selects the runtime approval policy before any interaction is raised:
`ask` (default on a TTY) asks for write-class tools and allows remembering, `always` asks for
every tool call and never remembers, `approve-all` never raises an approval interaction, and
`deny-all` rejects approval-requiring calls in the policy, before memory lookup or driver
interaction; read-only calls that do not require approval remain available. The policy is a per-process
preference: a run suspended under one mode can be resumed under another.

`--mode plan` hides write-class tools from the model (`RunConfig.enabled_tools` is set to the
agent's read-only / plan-safe tools; `goal_submit` stays available) on top of the read-only
sandbox. In that sandbox `execute_shell_command` accepts only the read-only inspection grammar
(`cat`, `grep`, `rg`, `find`, `ls`, `head`, `wc`, read-only `git` subcommands, … joined by pipes;
no redirection, control operators or paths in executables); the stages run directly from argv
without a shell and `git` runs with repository hooks, fsmonitor, pager, external diff and gpg
disabled. Anything else fails with `job.runner_failed` and a read-only message; the file
system stays read-only regardless. The local workspace **filesystem API** refuses writes under `.git/hooks` and
`.git/config`; those file API calls fail with `sandbox.protected_path` before writing.
This provider reports `IsolationLevel.NONE`: host subprocesses (including shell and Git)
can still modify these paths. `protected_paths` is not process isolation. A host needing
that guarantee must disable process execution or use an OS-isolated provider.

Validated `questionnaire_async` results arrive as public `item.completed` tool-result items.
The Run completes without a pending Interaction; the CLI and TUI display the supplied title,
questions and options, and the answer is the next ordinary user turn. Recovery Interactions
still use the decision frames above.

While a run is active (no interaction pending) the driver may append input for the next model step:

```json
{"type": "v2_steer", "text": "also update the tests"}
```

The CLI answers with `cli_v2_steer` (`status`: `accepted` | `rejected` | `unapplied`, `text`, `detail`).
`unapplied` is emitted at the end of a run for input that was accepted but never reached a next model
step; `sage v2 chat` then sends that text as the next message automatically. A decision
frame sent while no interaction is pending is reported as a rejected steer with
`detail: "no interaction is pending"`. In plain (non-JSON) mode steering is enabled only when stdin is
a terminal; lines piped into `sage v2 chat` are always treated as the next prompts.

`sage v2 sessions --json` is a one-shot command like `sage sessions --json`: it prints one JSON
object with `session_root`, `total`, `unreadable` (session ids whose state could not be read) and
`list` (newest first; each entry has `session_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_count`,
`last_run_id`, `last_state`, `agent_id`, `task`, `workspace`, `package_id`).

`sage v2 sessions inspect <session_id> --json` prints one JSON object: `session` (the same entry
shape as the listing) and `runs` (in order; each with `run_id`, `state`, `invocation_mode`,
`created_at`, `updated_at` and `entries` — `{kind: user|assistant|tool|interaction, text, detail?}`
rebuilt from the session's durable events).

`sage v2 chat --json` and `sage v2 resume <session_id> --json` repeat the run framing per turn:
between turns the CLI reads one plain-text prompt line from stdin (`/exit` ends the session);
while a run is active, stdin lines are interpreted only as decision lines. Every turn after the
first reuses the `session_id` announced by the first `cli_v2_session` frame.

`sage-terminal` consumes this surface when started with `--runtime v2` (or after `/runtime set v2`):
it spawns `sage v2 chat --json --user-id <id> [--workspace <path>]`, passes `--session-id` only for a
session id it previously received in a `cli_v2_session` frame, maps native `message.delta` /
`message.completed` / `tool.call.*` events onto its transcript, turns `approval` interactions into the
existing `/approve` (`approve_once`), `/remember` (`approve_and_remember`) and `/deny` flow, and answers
other interactions (`submit` / `change_direction`) with the next composer input or `/deny` (`cancel`).
Rust-side parsing lives in `app/terminal/src/backend/protocol_v2.rs` with tests in
`app/terminal/src/backend/tests/protocol_v2.rs`. Composer input typed while a run is active is sent as a
`v2_steer` frame and the `cli_v2_steer` answer is shown in the transcript; an approval must be
answered first (the CLI reads only decision lines then). With the v2 runtime selected, `/sessions`,
`/resume` and `/sessions inspect` read the v2 store through `sage v2 sessions --json` and
`sage v2 sessions inspect <id> --json` (the picker shows the first task, the run count and the last
run state; resuming replays the transcript entries and passes `--session-id` to the next backend).
The surface remains experimental.
